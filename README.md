# PlexAniBridge-Custom-Mappings 
 Custom mappings for the [PlexAniBridge](https://github.com/eliasbenb/PlexAniBridge) project
---
This repo contains alternative custom mappings for various series, for various scenarios, including:
 - Alternative TVDB episode orders where they differ substantively from the Aired Order (e.g. Monogatari DVD Order, Gundam Seed Remastered Airing, etc)
 - The primary TMDB episode order ~~where they differ substantively from the TVDB Aired Order~~
 - Alternative mapping to skip unneeded recaps while maintaining the correct watch count (e.g. Chobits, etc)
 - Other niche scenarios (e.g. The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, Cowboy Bebop DVD Order)

 This repo is *not* for the following:
 - Mappings for HAMA/ASS, or other alternative agents due to technical reasons.
 - Fan recuts/show edits where it cannot be associated with the original series' TVDB/TMDB ID (e.g. One Pace) for technical reasons.

 PRs are welcome, details about the format and technical capabilities can be found in the [PlexAniBridge custom mapping documentation](https://plexanibridge.elias.eu.org/advanced/custom-mappings/).
